# Arduino HTTPS Client Example



rename `constants.h.rename` to `constants.h`

Modify the renamed file, populating the two `#define` statements with the Wi-Fi network name (`ssid`) and password

```c
#define WIFI_SSID ""
#define WIFI_PSWD ""
```

When done, your file will look something like this:

```c
#define WIFI_SSID "myNetwork"
#define WIFI_PSWD "Some Complicated Wi-Fi Password"
```

with, of course,  your network name and password in there except for the ones I made up.
